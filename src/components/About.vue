        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Passionate about technology and a beginner in web development.
 I had my first contact with development in a tech course in 2011. In 2016 I entry in Military Police, and now, after 7 years I'm changing careers.
Years of experience in a military environment brought several soft skills, such as interpersonal relationships, being a team player, communication, resilience, and the ability to work under pressure.
I'm self-taught in programming, studying through documentation and courses like <a href="../../public/certificate.pdf" download="../../public/certificate.pdf">Web Design for Everybody: Basics of Web Development & Coding at the University of Michigan â‡©.</a>
 As a beginner, I'm willing to learn other technologies and ready to take a step forward working in a team of developers.
