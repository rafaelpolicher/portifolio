        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Passionate about technology and a beginner in web development.
 I had my first contact with development in a tech course in 2011. In 2016 I entry in Military Police, and now, after 7 years I'm changing careers.
Years of experience in a military environment brought several soft skills, such as interpersonal relationships, being a team player, communication, resilience, and the ability to work under pressure.
As a beginner, I'm willing to learn other technologies and ready to take a step forward working in a team of developers.</p>
